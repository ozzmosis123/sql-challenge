# sql-challenge

Sketched out an ERD of the tables on https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ before tables schema was created in PostgreSQL. Tables were based on six csv files that contained employee data from a fictitous company. 

PostgreSQL tables were then queried in various ways in queries.sql 

SQLAlchemy is then used to read in the postgreSQL database in order to use pandas dataframes and matplotlib visualizations on the SQL data.
